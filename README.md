# Space Systems Cost and Risk Modeler

This repository contains an Excel file with the data for the **Space Systems Cost and Risk Modeler (in development)**. This tool will conduct a financial risk assessment by analyzing the impact of architectural vulnerabilities on the cost of satellite components. 

The tool is still in development as I integrate Python. Upon finalization, it will be capable of analyzing component data sheets and assigning a "Risk Score."

### Research & Methodology
I conducted extensive research on satellite components to find basic specs, processor architecture, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. 

Many aerospace companies don't publicly disclose processor architectures, so I've added a notes section that states whether the architecture is:
* **Confirmed** through datasheets
* **Inferred** based on performance benchmarks and historical hardware architectures.
